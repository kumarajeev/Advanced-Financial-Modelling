Financial modeling is the process of estimating the financial performance of a project or business by taking into account all relevant factors, growth and risk assumptions, and interpreting their impact. It enables the user to acquire a concise knowledge of all the variables involved in financial forecasting.
There are various ways in which the financial modelling can be used in IIT Kanpur. For example we can use it for making the budget and decisions for various events and competitions organised in our campus. Based on the data of previous years we can ananlys the amount alloted to various things as for competitions,
 celebrities, arrangement for stay of participants,etc. This would give us the idea for better organisation of events. As our institute is a government aided so we should analyse the data by financial modelling on how thosew funds can be used in optimum possible way. Based on the need for various projects like infrastructure,
various facilities provided, food quality in the mess and canteen etc, so basically we can use this concept for things which vary from small to a large extent. By using this concept we can surely utilise the resources more efficiently.
